0.47  Jan 3, 2006

    - fix syntax error that snuck out in last release!

0.46  Jan 3, 2006

    - catch additional error message for potential retry

    - misc other cleanups merged in

0.44  Oct 1, 2004

    - now works with DBD::mysql v2.9000 and above

0.43  Sep 26, 2004

    - Oops, remove a debugging statement that had leaked into 0.42

0.42  Sep 24, 2004

    - Handle perl failures in a connect attempt (e.g. inability
      to load an underlying module).

0.41  Sep 13, 2004

    - This release has separate Timeout and QueryTimeout args for the
      Connect() method.

0.40  Sep 08, 2004

    - Various "internal" releases at Yahoo added some experimental
      connection related stuff.  See ConnectTimeoutOverride,
      ConnetTimeoutHook, ExecuteTimeoutHook, and PreConnectHook in the
      code if you're interested.  It will remain undocumented for now.

    - If Disconnect() is called and there's no valid handle, it
      shouldn't be an error.  A connectionless object may exist and be
      destroyed, which triggers a Disconnect() call in the destructor.

0.36  Feb 26, 2004

    - Setting $@ in Connect after $self was blessed didn't work, since
      $self's DESTROY was overwriting $@. So, undef $self before
      setting $@, and $@ actually remains available to the caller of
      Connect.

0.35  Feb 04, 2004

    - Make code match documentation for the NoRetry option.  It only
      affects the initial connection.

    - RetryWait now retries immediately a few times, before pausing.
      This provides faster re-connects to healthy servers.

    - Fixed some doc misspellings and updated contributors list.

0.34  Oct 20, 2003

    - MySQL 4.1 will do something substantive with prepare().  This
      update makes use of that by automatically calling
      prepare_cached() from any Execute, Scalar, etc, called with a
      query string and bind-args.  This tends to catch the calls
      inside loops, while not affecting other calls.

      Prepare() can still be used to manually cache the handle.

0.33  Aug 21, 2003

    - To match documentation as well as common expectations, Begin()
      returns 1 if called while already in a transaction.  Now you can
      do Begin() or die $@.

0.32  Thu Apr 17, 2003

    - fix bug in UNIQUE_KEY and %CurrentConnections which caused
      connections not to be removed from the cache

0.31  Fri Mar 21, 2003

    - don't let RetryWait() get called when a transaction is running

0.30  Wed Mar 19, 2003

    - revert the deadlock changes in 0.29 since it can cause
      unexpected behavior

0.29  Thu Jan 30, 2003

    - fix bug that cause cached connections not to be removed properly

    - made sure that list-returning functions always return () rather
      than undef

    - added FlatArrayRef() for working with very large flat lists

    - invoke the Retry/Wait logic on InnoDB deadlocks.

    - revised format of the Changes file so it's easier to read and
      edit.  It should be auto-generated, but the check-in messages
      aren't always clear.

0.28  Mon Nov 4, 2002

    - fix class checking in Disconnect() too

0.27  Mon Oct 28, 2002
